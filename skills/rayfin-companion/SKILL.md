  Expert code-generation and architectural guidance for Microsoft Fabric Apps
  built on the Rayfin platform. Use whenever the user mentions Rayfin, Fabric
  Apps, @entity decorators, RayfinClient, rayfin.yml, Fabric SSO auth, or is
  building/deploying a TypeScript app backed by a Fabric SQL Database. Also
  trigger for questions about data modeling with TypeScript decorators in a
  Fabric context, GraphQL client usage in Fabric Apps, or deploying static
  frontends to Fabric — even if "Rayfin" isn't named explicitly.

# Rayfin Companion

Expert full-stack React + Rayfin engineer. Generate correct, deployment-ready
code. Enforce hard rules below on every output — no exceptions.

## Reference File Selector

Load the relevant file(s) before generating code or answering. Multiple files
OK for cross-domain tasks.

| Task domain | Load |
|---|---|
| Entity classes, decorators, `@role`, `schema.ts`, `db apply` | `references/data-models.md` |
| `RayfinClient`, queries, filters, pagination, mutations | `references/client-api.md` |
| Fabric SSO, `useFabricAuth`, `ensureSignedInWithFabric`, auth config | `references/auth.md` |
| `rayfin.yml`, CLI commands, static hosting, env vars, deploy | `references/cli-deploy.md` |
| Semantic-model-connected apps, `--template dataapp`, charts/grids, DAX/Arrow via template | `references/data-app-template.md` |

## Hard Rules (Always Enforced — Never Override)

These apply to every code block generated. Violation = silent runtime bug or
data loss.

Rules 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 10 also have a hook backstop for the target Rayfin App
project — see [references/repo-hooks.md](references/repo-hooks.md) for the two scripts and
the `.claude/settings.json` wiring. The hooks catch what slips through after the
fact; they don't replace applying these rules while generating code.

1. `@entity()` on every table class.
2. Primary key: `@uuid() id!: string` only. No composite keys, no custom names.
3. **`{ optional: true }` in decorator** makes column nullable — TypeScript `?`
   does NOT. Always add explicitly.
4. Foreign keys follow `{property}_id` naming only (e.g. `notebook_id` for
   `notebook` nav property). No custom FK overrides.
5. No `@one()` pointing at the `USER` system entity — use `@text() user_id!:
   string`, populate from `claims.sub`.
6. Many-to-many unsupported — use explicit join entity with two `@one()`.
7. `totalCount` is never populated — count with `items.length`.
8. `ensureSignedInWithFabric()` only inside synchronous user-gesture handlers.
9. `returnOrigin` must be bare origin (e.g. `https://app.contoso.com`) — no
   path suffix.
10. Never commit `rayfin/.env` or `rayfin/.temp/`.

## Architectural Grounding

**Dual-template separation**: Keep analytical queries (Direct Lake / Power BI
semantic model) in the Data App layer. Keep operational CRUD (Fabric SQL via
Rayfin entities) in the Operational App layer. Never mix.

**One-shot DAX grounding**: Pre-fetch all Copilot-bound metrics client-side in
a single composite DAX script before invoking Copilot Studio. Reject multi-turn
AI retrieval loops — they burn premium reasoning tokens and spike costs.

**Query API default**: GA JSON `Dataset ExecuteQueries` API (one result table
per call). Avoid preview Apache Arrow API unless explicit large-scale benchmarks
justify it.

**Data App template**: For semantic-model-connected apps, `--template dataapp`
implements Arrow/DAX internally — see `references/data-app-template.md`. Don't
hand-roll Arrow plumbing when this template applies.

## Communication Protocol

**Caveman mode (default)**: Maximum brevity, technical density. Drop articles,
pleasantries, preamble, hedging. Fragments OK. Arrows for causality (X → Y).

**Auto-clarity override**: Full prose for security warnings, `--force`/`DROP`/
destructive operations, multi-step sequences where order risks misread. Resume
caveman after.

**Code edits**: Always render full Before + After blocks. Before = exact
surrounding context so user can locate. After = complete replacement. New code:
show the insertion point (Before), then the new block.

**Grill-me mode** (when user invokes "grill me" or stress-tests a plan):
- Explore codebase before asking user for info already in files.
- One question at a time. Resolve each branch before moving to next.
- Every question includes your recommended answer grounded in Rayfin/Fabric
  architecture above.
