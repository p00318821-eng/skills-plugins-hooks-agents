# Changelog

Dated by the day the work actually shipped (per git history), not by release
tag — this repo doesn't version by release.

## 2026-07-10

### Added
- Two global Claude Code hooks (`~/.claude/settings.json` + `~/.claude/hooks/`,
  outside this repo): `SessionStart` points Claude at HISD Power BI/Fabric
  context once per session; `PostToolUse` (scoped to `.tmdl` edits/writes)
  reminds Claude of HISD conventions after any `.tmdl` change — regardless of
  which skill (vendored or first-party) drove the edit. Reference copy at
  `skills/semantic-modeling-prepforai/references/global-hooks.md`.
- `skills/semantic-modeling-prepforai/references/hisd-power-bi-context.md`:
  consolidated HISD-specific content (synonym glossary, AI Instructions
  template, dual synonym-annotation mechanics, AI-consumer compatibility
  matrix, phantom-annotations list, relationship naming pattern) delivered by
  the hooks above.
- Fixed a pre-existing defect in the global `memory-architect` skill (outside
  this repo, `~/.claude/skills/memory-architect/`): its JIT-delivery design
  claimed a `PreToolUse` hook could inject `additionalContext` — verified
  false against official docs and a closed GitHub issue. Corrected to
  `PostToolUse` with `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` (not
  `updatedToolOutput`, which replaces rather than appends).

### Changed
- `skills/semantic-modeling-prepforai/`: deprecated as an actively-invoked
  skill. `SKILL.md` reduced to a deprecation notice; the manual copy/paste
  TMDL workflow and its Truncation Prevention protocol are obsolete now that
  editing happens via MCP-first tools. Folder retained only because it's
  still `scripts/sync_engine.py`'s distribution vehicle to `~/.claude/skills/`
  and `~/.agents/skills/`, which the new global hooks read from.
- `manifests/origins.json`: updated the `semantic-modeling-prepforai` excluded
  entry's `reason` to explain the deprecation and why the folder still exists.

### Removed
- `skills/semantic-modeling-prepforai/references/ai-compatibility-matrix.md`,
  `references/naming-conventions.yml`: content absorbed into
  `references/hisd-power-bi-context.md`.

## 2026-07-07

### Added
- `skills-workflow.ipynb`: single consolidated notebook (phase-selector widget
  over four independent phases — Ingest, Update from source, Assign
  destinations, Distribute), superseding the three notebooks below.
- `scripts/ingest_engine.py`, `scripts/update_engine.py`: pure-logic modules
  extracted from the retired notebooks/scripts, de-duplicating scan/classify/
  reconcile/apply and upstream-clone/diff/apply logic that previously existed
  in two parallel implementations each.
- `scripts/compile_claude_md.py`, `scripts/check_doc_links.py`: Python ports of
  the `project-memory-template` Hub-and-Spoke compile step and doc-link/sync
  checker, closing the gap where `.claude/CLAUDE.md` claimed to be a
  "GENERATED FILE" with no script that actually generated it.

### Changed
- `scripts/generate-destinations-csv.py` / `scripts/update-destinations-from-csv.py`
  renamed to underscore filenames and refactored into importable functions
  (`generate_csv`, `update_destinations_from_csv`), wired into the new
  notebook's Phase 3 instead of requiring a separate terminal step.
- `scripts/sync_engine.py`: removed `clone_upstream`/`extract_skill_content`/
  `fetch_skill` (unused — superseded by `scripts/update_engine.py`, which is
  now the single implementation of upstream fetch/diff logic).

### Removed
- `ingest-project.ipynb`, `update-sourced-skills.ipynb`, `sync_orchestrator.ipynb`:
  superseded by `skills-workflow.ipynb`.
- `scripts/ingest-destination.py`: retired CLI duplicate of the ingest
  notebook's logic (confirmed no external callers before removal).

## 2026-07-02

### Added
- Distribution system: `scripts/sync_engine.py` engine with idempotent
  boundary-marker injection, `sync_orchestrator.ipynb` notebook, and
  `manifests/destinations.json` manifest for routing skills to AI tool
  environments.
- `CLAUDE.md` with file map, SOPs, and environment gotchas.
- `.env.example` and `requirements.txt` (python-dotenv).
- `.cache/` directory (gitignored) for intermediate prompt cache.
- `ingest-project.ipynb`: two-phase workflow (dry-run + apply) to onboard an
  external project's skills into this repo and register the project as a
  distribution destination.
- 27 Azure/Entra/Foundry skills and the `plugins/azure-skills` package
  (Microsoft, `github.com/microsoft/skills`).
- 10 `wiki-*` documentation-generation skills and the `plugins/deep-wiki`
  package (same source).
- `skill-creator`, `mcp-builder` (Anthropic, `github.com/anthropics/skills`);
  `ponytail` (Dietrich Gebert); `microsoft-docs`, `continual-learning`,
  `github-issue-creator` (Microsoft, individually tracked); own skills
  `github-mastery`, `k12-dashboard-mockup`, `rayfin-companion`.

### Changed
- Migrated `skill-plugin-sources.json` to `manifests/origins.json` (format v2)
  with `type` and `format` fields. Old path is a one-line redirect stub.
- Fixed stale `local` paths in origins manifest to reflect the `skills/` move
  (e.g. `"grill-me"` → `"skills/grill-me"`).
- Updated `update-sourced-skills.ipynb` to read from `manifests/origins.json`.
- Expanded `.gitignore` to cover `.cache/`, `.env`, and `__pycache__/`.
- Adopted the Hub-and-Spoke memory architecture (Compiled-only rung — see
  `.ai/LINEAGE.md`): `CLAUDE.md` moved to `.claude/CLAUDE.md` and rewritten as a
  compiled pointer file; `docs/PROJECT-NOTES.md` renamed to root `ARCHITECTURE.md`
  with environment-gotchas and historical-narrative content relocated to
  `.ai/rules/000-agent-operating-mandates.md` and `.ai/archive/` respectively;
  attribution consolidated onto `README.md` (regenerated the skill table to cover
  all 93 skills, up from 44); `skill-plugin-sources.json` deleted (superseded by
  `manifests/origins.json`).

### Removed
- `skill-plugin-sources.json` orphaned stub — fully superseded by
  `manifests/origins.json`, no remaining references.

## 2026-06-02

### Added
- `skill-plugin-sources.json` manifest and `update-sourced-skills.ipynb` notebook to
  check externally-sourced skills for upstream updates, show a per-skill
  change-list with diffs, and apply or disregard each one.
- Vendored MIT `LICENSE` into each Matt Pocock skill folder (`caveman`,
  `grill-me`, `grill-with-docs`, `handoff`, `improve-codebase-architecture`).
- `docs/PROJECT-NOTES.md` capturing repository conventions, the update workflow,
  known updater limitations, and local-environment notes.
- This changelog.

### Changed
- Migrated from Git submodules to plain, self-contained per-skill folders
  (one `SKILL.md` per folder). Removed `.gitmodules` and the `mattpocock/`,
  `changyuanyu/`, and `my-custom-skills/` wrappers.
- Promoted `pbi-visual-rendering` and `semantic-modeling-prepforai` to top-level
  folders.
- Flattened `mbti-persona` out of its wrapper, keeping its upstream `LICENSE`.
- Rewrote `README.md` with a skills table, per-skill attribution, and update
  instructions; retitled the project `skills` to match the repository rename
  from `ben-skills`.

### Notes
- `caveman` is intentionally excluded from automated updates because it has been
  locally modified.
