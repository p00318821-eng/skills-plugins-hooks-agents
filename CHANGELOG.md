# Changelog

Dated by the day the work actually shipped (per git history), not by release
tag — this repo doesn't version by release.

## 2026-07-10

### Added
- `memory-architect`: `scripts/detect-structure.js` (mechanical AUDIT/SCAFFOLD
  detection — file presence, legacy paths, template markers, repo type, on
  demand, not a hook — there's no tool-use event that means "run an audit"),
  `hooks/validation-gate.js` (global `Stop` hook: blocks ending a turn if `.ai/`
  is dirty and `build`/`lint`/`check:docs` fail; installed live in
  `~/.claude/settings.json` + `~/.claude/hooks/`), `agents/memory-consolidator.md`
  (dispatchable agent for CONSOLIDATE mode's scan/classify/propose loop),
  `references/global-hooks.md`, `references/agents.md`.
- `rayfin-companion`: `hooks/check-rayfin-rules.cjs` (`PostToolUse` backstop for
  hard rules 2/3/5/7/9) and `hooks/guard-rayfin-secrets.cjs` (`PreToolUse` guard
  blocking `git add`/`commit` of `rayfin/.env`/`rayfin/.temp/`, rule 10),
  `references/repo-hooks.md`. Installed live into both real Rayfin App projects
  (`fabric-apps/fabric-app-campus-profile`,
  `fabric-apps/fabric-app-student-profile`).
- `.ai/rules/200-hook-authoring-conventions.md` equivalent promoted upstream to
  `project-memory-template` (this repo's canonical reference) — see that repo's
  changelog/PLAN for the consolidation pass.

### Changed
- `memory-architect/SKILL.md`: AUDIT and SCAFFOLD modes now call
  `scripts/detect-structure.js` instead of re-deriving file-presence/legacy/
  template-marker facts by hand; CONSOLIDATE mode now dispatches
  `memory-consolidator` instead of running the scan/classify/propose loop inline.
- `rayfin-companion/SKILL.md`: Hard Rules section now points at the hook
  backstop for rules 2/3/5/7/9/10.
- Hook reference-doc naming standardized: `global-hooks.md` (installs once,
  applies to every repo) vs `repo-hooks.md` (installs per target project) —
  `memory-architect` and `rayfin-companion` renamed to match; `hooks/*.js`
  renamed to `hooks/*.cjs` for `rayfin-companion` after both real installs threw
  `ReferenceError: require is not defined` in the target projects' ESM
  (`"type": "module"`) `package.json`.

### Removed
- `skills/rayfin-companion/rayfin-companion/` — stale nested duplicate (byte-
  identical reference files, missing only `data-app-template.md` versus the
  root copy).

## 2026-07-07

### Added
- `skills-workflow.ipynb`: single consolidated notebook (phase-selector widget
  over four independent phases — Ingest, Update from source, Assign
  destinations, Distribute), superseding the three notebooks below.
- `scripts/ingest_engine.py`, `scripts/update_engine.py`: pure-logic modules
  extracted from the retired notebooks/scripts, de-duplicating scan/classify/
  reconcile/apply and upstream-clone/diff/apply logic that previously existed
  in two parallel implementations each.
- `scripts/compile_claude_md.py`, `scripts/check_doc_links.py`: Python ports of
  the `project-memory-template` Hub-and-Spoke compile step and doc-link/sync
  checker, closing the gap where `.claude/CLAUDE.md` claimed to be a
  "GENERATED FILE" with no script that actually generated it.

### Changed
- `scripts/generate-destinations-csv.py` / `scripts/update-destinations-from-csv.py`
  renamed to underscore filenames and refactored into importable functions
  (`generate_csv`, `update_destinations_from_csv`), wired into the new
  notebook's Phase 3 instead of requiring a separate terminal step.
- `scripts/sync_engine.py`: removed `clone_upstream`/`extract_skill_content`/
  `fetch_skill` (unused — superseded by `scripts/update_engine.py`, which is
  now the single implementation of upstream fetch/diff logic).

### Removed
- `ingest-project.ipynb`, `update-sourced-skills.ipynb`, `sync_orchestrator.ipynb`:
  superseded by `skills-workflow.ipynb`.
- `scripts/ingest-destination.py`: retired CLI duplicate of the ingest
  notebook's logic (confirmed no external callers before removal).

## 2026-07-02

### Added
- Distribution system: `scripts/sync_engine.py` engine with idempotent
  boundary-marker injection, `sync_orchestrator.ipynb` notebook, and
  `manifests/destinations.json` manifest for routing skills to AI tool
  environments.
- `CLAUDE.md` with file map, SOPs, and environment gotchas.
- `.env.example` and `requirements.txt` (python-dotenv).
- `.cache/` directory (gitignored) for intermediate prompt cache.
- `ingest-project.ipynb`: two-phase workflow (dry-run + apply) to onboard an
  external project's skills into this repo and register the project as a
  distribution destination.
- 27 Azure/Entra/Foundry skills and the `plugins/azure-skills` package
  (Microsoft, `github.com/microsoft/skills`).
- 10 `wiki-*` documentation-generation skills and the `plugins/deep-wiki`
  package (same source).
- `skill-creator`, `mcp-builder` (Anthropic, `github.com/anthropics/skills`);
  `ponytail` (Dietrich Gebert); `microsoft-docs`, `continual-learning`,
  `github-issue-creator` (Microsoft, individually tracked); own skills
  `github-mastery`, `k12-dashboard-mockup`, `rayfin-companion`.

### Changed
- Migrated `skill-plugin-sources.json` to `manifests/origins.json` (format v2)
  with `type` and `format` fields. Old path is a one-line redirect stub.
- Fixed stale `local` paths in origins manifest to reflect the `skills/` move
  (e.g. `"grill-me"` → `"skills/grill-me"`).
- Updated `update-sourced-skills.ipynb` to read from `manifests/origins.json`.
- Expanded `.gitignore` to cover `.cache/`, `.env`, and `__pycache__/`.
- Adopted the Hub-and-Spoke memory architecture (Compiled-only rung — see
  `.ai/LINEAGE.md`): `CLAUDE.md` moved to `.claude/CLAUDE.md` and rewritten as a
  compiled pointer file; `docs/PROJECT-NOTES.md` renamed to root `ARCHITECTURE.md`
  with environment-gotchas and historical-narrative content relocated to
  `.ai/rules/000-agent-operating-mandates.md` and `.ai/archive/` respectively;
  attribution consolidated onto `README.md` (regenerated the skill table to cover
  all 93 skills, up from 44); `skill-plugin-sources.json` deleted (superseded by
  `manifests/origins.json`).

### Removed
- `skill-plugin-sources.json` orphaned stub — fully superseded by
  `manifests/origins.json`, no remaining references.

## 2026-06-02

### Added
- `skill-plugin-sources.json` manifest and `update-sourced-skills.ipynb` notebook to
  check externally-sourced skills for upstream updates, show a per-skill
  change-list with diffs, and apply or disregard each one.
- Vendored MIT `LICENSE` into each Matt Pocock skill folder (`caveman`,
  `grill-me`, `grill-with-docs`, `handoff`, `improve-codebase-architecture`).
- `docs/PROJECT-NOTES.md` capturing repository conventions, the update workflow,
  known updater limitations, and local-environment notes.
- This changelog.

### Changed
- Migrated from Git submodules to plain, self-contained per-skill folders
  (one `SKILL.md` per folder). Removed `.gitmodules` and the `mattpocock/`,
  `changyuanyu/`, and `my-custom-skills/` wrappers.
- Promoted `pbi-visual-rendering` and `semantic-modeling-prepforai` to top-level
  folders.
- Flattened `mbti-persona` out of its wrapper, keeping its upstream `LICENSE`.
- Rewrote `README.md` with a skills table, per-skill attribution, and update
  instructions; retitled the project `skills` to match the repository rename
  from `ben-skills`.

### Notes
- `caveman` is intentionally excluded from automated updates because it has been
  locally modified.
